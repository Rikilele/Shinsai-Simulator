15-112 S16 Term Project
"Shinsai-Simulator"
created by Riki Singh Khorana (rkhorana + MM)

This project is a simulator of a situation where an earthquake has hit a model 
city, and there is a need for evacuation because of a tsunami. The project features timers counting up from when the earthquake has last stopped (so that you can walk properly), a Tsunami that quickly erodes your "health", and a randomly generated city placed on a terrain modeled from a real life town.

As this project utilizes the Panda3D library, you will need to install the library from this website updated and maintained by Carnegie Mellon.
---> http://www.panda3d.org/download.php
I recommend downloading the Panda3D SDK for Developers just because it gives you a lot of sample programs that you can play around with. Panda3D supports coding in Python, and the downloaded file of Panda3D already has a Python (2) for you to use straight off.

Once Panda3D is downloaded, you must go to your Terminal window (Mac), or the equivalent for any other os. You should locate the file "Shinsai-Simulator", so that all the top level files are accessible. 

The command
---> ppython Shinsai-Simulator.py
should bring up the screen!
