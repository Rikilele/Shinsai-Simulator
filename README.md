# Shinsai-Simulator

Term Project for 15-112 at Carnegie Mellon University.

Created by Riki Singh Khorana

### Purpose
This project was initiated to inspire many other product-developers to build a realistic simulator of a _shinsai_ (Japanese word for “earthquake disaster”).

March 11, 2016 marked the fifth year since the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami hit Tohoku, Japan. Although the awareness of preparing for emergencies have risen considerably since the event, there are still many people who are not yet mentally prepared to face the situation. After all, such abnormal events are still considered “fiction” before we face it. This is why I decided to work on a simulation software that could recreate the city that we live in, and show the destruction that a tsunami would cause. Watching realistic scenes of your own town being destroyed will bring shock, but also awareness.

### How to use the app
Download Shinsai-Simulator from this GitHub repository using the Download ZIP button, and unzip the file in a directory that you would remember. If that doesn’t work, use your terminator/command line to download the repository as shown [here](https://help.github.com/articles/importing-a-git-repository-using-the-command-line/).

This app utilizes the Panda3D framework maintained by Carnegie Mellon University. To download the framework, access the Panda3D website via [this link] (http://www.panda3d.org/download.php). The "_Panda3D Runtime for End-Users_" should be sufficient in running Shinsai-Simulator. However, I do recommend downloading the "_Panda3D SDK for Developers_" because you can change a few settings of Shinsa-Simulator to your own preferences, and it comes with a lot of sample programs that you can play around with! Panda3D has it’s own version of Python available for use, so you do not have to download Python separately. (To change Panda3D settings to run the program using your own version of Python, refer to [this link](https://www.panda3d.org/manual/index.php/General_Preparation))

Once Panda3D is downloaded, locate your Shinsai-Simulator folder via the Command Line.

`cd exampleDirectory/exampleFolder1/exampleFolder2/Shinsai-Simulator`

Then type in:

`ppython Shinsai-Simulator.py`


The main app controls are gone over in the video below:
